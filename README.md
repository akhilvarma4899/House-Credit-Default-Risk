# House-Credit-Default-Risk
The goal of the HCDR competition is to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. In order to make sure that people who struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories have a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
